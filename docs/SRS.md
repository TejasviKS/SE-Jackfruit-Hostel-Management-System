# 1. Introduction

**Owner: P1 (Student & Access Management)**

## 1.1 Purpose

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and nonfunctional requirements for Version 1.0 of the Hostel Management System. The system is a web-based application developed for the Software Engineering course at PES University to manage student information, hostel room allocation, fee payment records, complaints, and leave requests for a single hostel. The system provides separate functionality for Student and Admin users.

## 1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

This document is intended for the Hostel Management System development team, the Software Engineering course teacher/evaluator, and testers responsible for verifying the system. The SRS is organized into the Introduction, Overall Description, External Interface Requirements, Analysis Models, System Features, Other Nonfunctional Requirements, Other Requirements, and Appendices.

## 1.3 Product Scope

The Hostel Management System is intended to replace manual register- and notebook-based management of student information, hostel room allocation, fee records, complaints, and leave requests with a centralized web application. The system is intended for students and administrators managing a single hostel. It supports two user roles only: Student and Admin. The Student can manage their profile, view room and fee information, submit complaints, and submit leave requests, while the Admin can manage student accounts, rooms, room allocation, fee records, complaints, and leave requests. The system does not include a Warden role, visitor management, a room-change request workflow, online payment gateway integration, receipt/PDF generation, or multi-hostel management.

## 1.4 References

The following references were used in preparing this Software Requirements Specification:

1. Jackfruit — Software Engineering Project Guidelines 2026.
2. Django Documentation — documentation for the Django web framework used by the project.
3. PostgreSQL Documentation — documentation for the PostgreSQL database management system used by the project.

# 2. Overall Description

**Owner: P3 (Fee Management)**

## 2.1 Product Perspective

The Hostel Management System is a new, self-contained, standalone web application developed specifically for this course project. It is not a follow-on to, or replacement of, any existing production system, and it does not integrate with any larger institutional system. It is being built as a mini-project for the Software Engineering course (UE24CS341A) and is scoped as a demonstration system, not a production deployment.

## 2.2 Product Functions

* Student registration, login, and profile management
* Room and block setup, and room allocation/deallocation
* Fee structure setup and payment record tracking
* Complaint filing/tracking and leave request/approval

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Class | Privileges                                                                                                                                       | Characteristics                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Student    | Register, view/edit own profile, view room, view fee dues, file complaints, submit leave requests                                                | Non-technical, occasional use  |
| Admin      | Verify student accounts, manage rooms, allocate/deallocate rooms, define fee structure, record payments, manage complaints, approve/reject leave | Higher privilege, trained user |

*(Only two user classes.)*

## 2.4 Operating Environment

The system is a web application accessed through any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). It is built using Python 3.x with the Django web framework, and uses PostgreSQL as the backend database. It is developed and demonstrated locally (and later via Docker), with no additional client-side installation required beyond a browser.

## 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

* Must be built using Python (Django), per the team's chosen tech stack.
* Single hostel/single campus scope — no multi-hostel support.
* Two user roles only: Student and Admin. No payment gateway integration — fee payments are admin-recorded entries, not processed transactions.
* Agile/Scrum methodology mandatory; GitHub used for backlog, issues, and pull requests, with CI running tests on every PR.

## 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

* Assumes an admin verifies new student accounts before a room can be allocated to them.
* Assumes fee payments happen outside the system (cash/bank transfer) and are simply recorded by the admin — the system does not process, authorize, or validate any actual payment transaction.
* Depends on Django's built-in authentication and ORM; no other major third-party service is required for this scope.

# 3. External Interface Requirements

**Owner: P2 (Room & Allocation Management)**

## 3.1 User Interfaces

* Describe main screens: Student dashboard, Room/allocation screen, Fee details screen, Complaint/Leave screen, Admin dashboard.
* Formatting conventions to keep consistent across the app (error message style, status badges, form validation messages).
* Optional: a simple text/wireframe mock-up of one key screen.

## 3.2 Software Interfaces

* Backend framework + version, DB engine + version, ORM used (Django ORM).
* Confirm: no external payment gateway library/SDK is used in this version.

## 3.3 Communications Interfaces

* REST API / HTTP between frontend and backend if applicable, or plain Django templates (state which architecture your team is using).
* Email notification interface, if implemented — otherwise state "Not applicable."

## 3.4 Hardware Interfaces

* Standard: browser + keyboard/mouse only, no special hardware.

---

# 4. Analysis Models

**Owner: P2**

* Include a use case diagram covering both actors (Student, Admin) and the use cases listed in Section 5 / the Use Cases table below.
* Include an ER diagram covering core entities: `Student`, `Room`, `Block`, `Fee`, `PaymentRecord`, `Complaint`, `LeaveRequest`. No `Visitor` entity, no `RoomChangeRequest` entity.
* Draw.io/PlantUML export as an image, inserted here, is fine.

# 5. System Features

> **Shared vocabulary — do not rename these across sections, and do not reintroduce removed terms:**
> `Student`, `Admin`, `Room`, `Block`, `Fee`, `PaymentRecord`, `Complaint`, `LeaveRequest`, `RBAC`.

## 5.1 Student & Access Management

**Owner: P1**

### Description and Priority

Student registration (with admin verification), login for both roles, role-based access control, student profile management. **Priority: High** — every other feature depends on this.

### Stimulus/Response Sequences

* *"Student submits registration form → account created in 'Pending' state → Admin verifies → account activated → student can log in."*
* Cover invalid input: *"User submits invalid/duplicate email → validation error shown → form redisplayed."*

### Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                                   | Priority | Verification       |

## 5.2 Room & Allocation Management

**Owner: P2**

### Description and Priority

Room/block setup, capacity and availability tracking, direct allocation and deallocation by the admin. **Priority: High.** *(No room-change-request workflow in this version — if a student needs a different room, the admin deallocates and reallocates directly.)*

### Stimulus/Response Sequences

* *"Admin allocates an available room to a verified student → room status updates to 'Occupied' → student sees their room on their dashboard."*
* *"Admin deallocates a student from a room (e.g. on checkout) → room status updates to 'Vacant'."*

### Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                                                             | Priority | Verification     |

## 5.3 Fee Management

**Owner: P3**

### Description and Priority

Fee structure setup and payment record tracking, expressed purely as amounts (no gateway, no receipts). **Priority: High.**

### Stimulus/Response Sequences

* *"Admin sets a fee amount for a student/room type → student sees the amount due → admin records a payment entry → system recalculates and displays the outstanding balance."*

### Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                          | Priority | Verification    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- |

| REQ-13 | The system shall calculate the outstanding fee amount as fee due minus total recorded payments.      | High     | Unit test       |
| REQ-14 | The system shall prevent a recorded payment amount from exceeding the outstanding balance.           | High     | Negative test   |
| REQ-15 | The system shall allow a student to view their fee amount, payment history, and outstanding balance. | Medium   | Functional test |
| REQ-16 | The system shall allow an admin to view a report of outstanding dues across all students.            | Medium   | Functional test |

## 5.4 Complaints & Leave Management

**Owner: P4**

### Description and Priority

This module allows students to submit and track maintenance complaints related to their allocated room. It also allows students to submit leave or outing requests for a specified date range. The Admin can view submitted complaints, update their status, and approve or reject student leave requests.

**Priority: Medium** — supporting operational features.

### Stimulus/Response Sequences

**Complaint Submission:**

Student submits a maintenance complaint → system validates the complaint details → complaint is created with status `Open` → Admin can view the complaint → Admin updates the complaint status to `In-progress` or `Resolved` → student can view the updated status.

**Leave Request Submission:**

Student submits a leave/outing request with the required date range and reason → system validates the request → leave request is created with status `Pending` → Admin reviews the request → Admin approves or rejects the request → student can view the decision.

### Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                           | Priority | Verification    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| REQ-17 | The system shall allow a student to file a maintenance complaint tied to their allocated room.        | High     | Functional test |
| REQ-18 | The system shall allow an admin to update complaint status as `Open`, `In-progress`, or `Resolved`.   | High     | Functional test |
| REQ-19 | The system shall allow a student to submit a leave/outing request with a valid date range and reason. | High     | Functional test |
| REQ-20 | The system shall allow an admin to approve or reject a pending leave request.                         | High     | Functional test |
